Welcome to my project! This repository is dedicated to sharing Python code snippets and examples aimed at enhancing your understanding of various programming concepts. As part of this collection, I've included code snippets related to command-line interface (CLI) development using Python's CMD module.

About CMD in Python
The CMD module in Python provides a framework for building command-line interpreters. With CMD, you can create interactive command-line programs with ease, allowing users to navigate through commands and execute actions. It simplifies the process of developing CLI applications, making them more user-friendly and efficient.
